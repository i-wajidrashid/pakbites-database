1.	What is the difference between git fetch and git pull?
Git pull downloads all information from remote repository to local device and Git fetch downloads any selected information from remote repository to local device.

2.	Explain what a "detached HEAD" state is and how you might end up in one.
A detached HEAD state in Git occurs when the HEAD pointer points directly to a commit hash instead of a branch name and new commits will not be attached to any branch. 
You might end up in this state by checking out a commit (git checkout <hash>) of remote branch directly. 

3.	What does git stash do and when would you use it?
Stash means temporarily saving any file in remote location. Stash is used when there are merge conflicts.

4.	What is the difference between git merge and git rebase? Which is safer for beginners?
Git merge and Git rebase are both used to integrate changes from one branch to another 
but Git merge maintains a linear history, while Git rebase rewrites the project history. 
For beginners, Git Merge is safer than Git rebase. 

5.	Why should you never push sensitive information (passwords, API keys) to GitHub?
Sensitive information should never be pushed to GitHub because the remote repository may be Public and everyone would be allowed to see that sensitive information.
